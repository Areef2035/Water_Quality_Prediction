# 💧 Water Quality Prediction 

This project aims to **predict multiple water quality parameters** using machine learning techniques, specifically `MultiOutputRegressor` wrapped around a `RandomForestRegressor`.  
---

## 🌍 Overview

Access to clean water is a **critical global concern**. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in **early detection of pollution** and ensure timely intervention.

In this project, we:

- Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets
- Applied **supervised machine learning** for **multi-target regression**
- Built a pipeline using `MultiOutputRegressor` with `RandomForestRegressor`
- Evaluated the model using **standard regression metrics**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data handling
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning model and evaluation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive experimentation

## 🔍 Predicted Water Quality Parameters

The model predicts the following water quality parameters:

- NH₄ (Ammonium)
- BOD₅ (BSK5 - Biochemical Oxygen Demand)
- Colloids
- O₂ (Dissolved Oxygen)
- NO₃ (Nitrate)
- NO₂ (Nitrite)
- SO₄ (Sulfate)
- PO₄ (Phosphate)
- CL (Chloride)

## 📊 Model Performance

The model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **R² Score**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

✅ Performance was acceptable across all parameters.
